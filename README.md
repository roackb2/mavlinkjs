# What's This

This repository is an npm module and a JavaScript MAVLink implementation to parse MAVLink messages, generated using [Parrot MAVLink repository](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/mavlink/tree/master/pymavlink/generator/javascript),
with the multiple dialects, including `all` and `common` for now, using Mavlink v1.0 protocol.
